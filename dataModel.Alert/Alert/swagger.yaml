    Alert:
      type: object
      description: |
        This entity contains a description of an alert reported by a device or user at a certain time.
        This data model has been partially developed based on the "Alert" data model available on the SmartDataModels database.
        It is an extension of the data model and introduces the following changes:
        
        - The required fields `alertSource`, `category` are no longer considered required.
        
        - The field `dateIssued` is changed to `dateObserved` to keep consistency with other models.

        - The field "subCategory" contains an additional value in the enum "accident" that is considered a general accident
