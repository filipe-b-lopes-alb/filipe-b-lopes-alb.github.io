        This entity contains a description of the state of Vehicles over time. This entity is associated with the vertical segments of  smart cities and related IoT applications.
        This data model has been partially developed based on the "Vehicle" data model available on the SmartDataModels database.
        It is an extension of the data model and introduces the following changes:
        
        - The field `vehicleType`, `location` and `category` are no longer required since they don't add additional required information in our system.
        - The field `observationDateTime` is changed to `dateObserved` and is now required.
